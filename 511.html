      <h2>5&times;&times; Server Error</h2>
      <h1><span>511</span> Network Authentication Required</h1><p>The client needs to authenticate to gain network access.</p>
<p>The response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit credentials (e.g., with an HTML form).</p>
<p>Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.</p>
<p>The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of controlling access to the network.</p>
<p>Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.</p>
<p>The 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by &quot;captive portals&quot; to software (especially non-browser agents) that is expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not the intervening network infrastructure. It is not intended to encourage deployment of captive portals -- only to limit the damage caused by them.</p>
<p>A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance of terms, or other user interaction before granting access usually does so by identifying clients who have not done so (&quot;unknown clients&quot;) using their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.</p>
<p>Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP port 80, which is sent to an HTTP server (the &quot;login server&quot;) dedicated to &quot;logging in&quot; unknown clients, and of course traffic to the login server itself.</p>
<p>For example, a user agent might connect to a network and make the following HTTP request on TCP port 80:</p>
<pre><code>GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
</code></pre><p>Upon receiving such a request, the login server would generate a 511 response:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 511 Network Authentication Required
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Network Authentication Required&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0; url=https://login.example.net/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://login.example.net/&quot;&gt;
    authenticate with the local network&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain
    access.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Here, the 511 status code assures that non-browser clients will not interpret the response as being from the origin server, and the META HTML element redirects the user agent to the login server.</p>
